# Low-Cost, Multi-Modal Road Defect Detection & Assessment

Urban road maintenance still depends on laborintensive inspections, ad-hoc citizen reports, or infrequent and costly mobile surveys. These conventional methods are often slow, inaccurate, or prohibitively expensive, resulting in incomplete data and delayed maintenance actions by municipalities. In response, we propose a cost-effective, finegrained road defect detection system that fuses top-down camera imagery with LiDAR-derived depth data to generate pixel-level RGBD representations of road surfaces. These fused inputs are processed using deep learning models to detect, classify, and grade road defects—specifically cracks and potholes—under varying lighting and weather conditions. To identify an effective detection system, we auto-annotate the dataset using a pretrained YOLOv8 and SAM-2 model and finetune and evaluate three distinct models: Swin-Small, PVT-Small, and CoAtNet-0, to determine a more nuanced classification and assessment. System validation is conducted on road networks surrounding the neighborhoods of the University of Washington and the City of Seattle where we anticipate precise defect identification and geolocation at significantly reduced costs compared to current surveying methodologies.
